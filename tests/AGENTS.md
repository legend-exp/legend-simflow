# AGENTS.md — Testing

Python tests are stored in `tests/` and managed with Pytest. Julia tests are in
`workflow/src/LegendSimflow.jl/test/`. Run all tests with `pixi run test`.

- `conftest.py`: fixtures to create mock configuration objects required to test
  package units
- `test_workflow.py`: integration Snakemake testing of the workflow with a dummy
  production (configured in `tests/dummyprod`) that can be tested in CI
- `l200data/`: test data for the LEGEND-200 data production
